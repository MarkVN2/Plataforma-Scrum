The agile methodology is capable of accomplishing complex projects in a simple and manageable way.
Start your journey with this tool, revolutionize the way your team works and start having double the performance.

METODOLOGIA - INTRODUCTION
In the current accelerated and innovative market, for a company to stay modern, it needs to adapt itself to changes that tecnology is implementing and find, in midst of this hectic scenario, opportunities to accomplish a relevant work.

Having this point of view is crucial for an institution of success to establish adequate methods that will guide the actions that will be taken in its work environment.

In the past, the main methodology adopted by many institutions became popularly known as "Assembly line" or "Cascade method"
(GIF REVOLUÇÃO INDUSTRIAL/LINHA DE PRODUÇÃO/FORDISMO)

This traditional production system was inherited from the fordist development, during the second industrial revolution, and had as a principle the establishment of specific and repetitive tasks, designated to certain individuals that would little by little be added until they resulted in the expected final product.

This proceedure kept going for a while, however it was shown to be inefficient and certain inconstancies that delayed the process were revealed, mainly during the executions of more complex tasks.

(CONTEÚDO EXTRA - ONE STEP FORWARD... BUT ON THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION Some examples of disadvantages in the cascade method of production are:
- Late evaluation (Being late to sinalize flaws in the process)
- Stagnation of the process (leaving part of the work force idle while they await for the moment to carry out their task)

IMAGEM - COMMUNICATION AND PROCESS FAILURE

What's the point of making multiple advancements, if they go against what the client really wants? the sum of these gaps in the production process are translated as delays and damages for the company, and insatisfaction for the client.
)

METODOLOGIA - WHAT IS SCRUM?
It was designed to obtain a way of increasing the performance and profitability in the development, and companies started adopting the so called Agile Methodologies, Tools that aim to offer better work conditions and the resolution of tasks with more cost-effectiveness. In midst of them, there's the methodology which we will be addressing in this content.

SCRUM

Unlike other methodologies, this framework has as a foundation, the establishment of a self-managing team, adaptable to changes and that lets go of the entire reinforced structure of professional hierarchy, in favor of promoting a better dynamicity and flow for the team, aiming to carry out more meaningful deliveries to the project.

(IMAGEM DO SCRUM RUGBY)

The name Scrum comes from a game of rugby, in which the players of a team get together and break through the obstacles of the opposing team until they reach the score line, all done strategically and collaboratively. This is the essence that Scrum brings to the workplace.

METODOLOGIA - VISION
In a Scrum team, everyone is aware of the product vision, the objectives to be achieved and the requirements that have been determined to be executed. 

There is no member who has any level of leadership or authority to impose instructions on the others (with the exception of cases where there is an external person responsible for coordinating the progress of the project, who is not a member of the team).

Thus, it is up to the members to manage for themselves the ways in which they will organize themselves, what each individual's responsibilities will be and the metrics for evaluating performance.

The application of this methodology is based on the Agile Manifesto and its 4 main values:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

METODOLOGIA - PILLARS
At all times, Scrum prioritizes the delivery of elements which, even if they have not reached the expected projection for the final product, already have functionality and can be applied.

In order to achieve this goal, the so-called Scrum Artifacts are established, which are fundamental elements in project management and will be detailed one by one throughout this content.

This whole methodology is based on the MVP principle, or Minimum Viable Product. Its aim is to promote successive incremental deliveries that add value to the client, and in some cases are even capable of generating a profitable return on investment in the early stages of the project.

(CONTEÚDO EXTRA - HOW TO DEFINE THE MVP
Production based on the MVP will always aim to make gradual deliveries that meet customer demand. As in the example below. 

(IMAGEM SKATE/PATINS/CARRO)

A customer who wants a car to get around won't be completely satisfied when they receive a skateboard on the first delivery, but they will already have a usable item in their hands that adds value. The opposite happens in the other case, where even after three deliveries, the customer still can't get any use out of what they've received so far.
)

What's more, because of this constant validation with the client, if any of their expectations are not met or there is any kind of failure in the execution, it can be remedied in its early stages.

Finally, another crucial feature of Scrum is that there are no interruptions in production to wait for another task to be developed. Tasks are delegated, but they are independent of each other.

This whole theory is based on the following pillars:

Transparency: The members of the group need to be transparent at all times about the progress of their task, their needs and their perceptions. This team integration is essential, as no one can know what the other is going through unless they speak up and ask for help.
(ÍCONE - APERTO DE MÃOS)

Inspection: The process is made up of iteration, trial and error. It is therefore necessary for the group to frequently assess whether the decisions and planning chosen are delivering the expected result.
(ÍCONE - LUPA)

Adaptation: Scrum development is full of changes. Naturally, some planned elements will lose the value they had when they were first conceived, making a series of adaptations necessary. Remember, this method encourages dynamism, not rigidity.
(ÍCONE - CICLO DE MUDANÇAS DE FORMAS)

METODOLOGIA - Self-evaluation
The essence of Scrum teams is their ability to be self-managing. 

This skill allows them to abstract themselves from the situations and scenarios in which they find themselves so that they can analyze the process from a critical point of view. 

This is a fundamental stage of production, because after long hours of development, in which the developers are absorbed in their creativity and ideas, the moments of alignment of vision will be important to ensure that the project maintains the identity and objectives that have been established.

Therefore, when the Sprint's closing date arrives, the team will hold its Sprint Review, in which everything that has been developed during this period will be presented to everyone involved in the project. At this point, the team will be able to receive external feedback on the development of the work, from which they can direct their future resolutions.

(IMAGEM REUNIÃO AUTOAVALIAÇÃO)

The ideal stage for the team to take stock of its own performance is the Sprint Retrospective period. Here, the team will have a meeting to get an overview of how the project is going. 

(CONTEÚDO EXTRA - PUTTING THE HOUSE IN ORDER
In this process of 'washing dirty clothes', it's important that the individuals not only highlight the negative points, but also the positive points of the group and individual highlights. 
(GIF LAVAGEM DE ROUPA)
Moreover, this is the right time to express ideas and opinions).

This is the moment when each team member can evaluate their colleagues' performance and receive feedback on how they have collaborated on the project.

Some individual points that can be taken into account are delivery of results, autonomy, cooperation, proactivity, among others.

(CONTEÚDO EXTRA - SELF-ASSESSMENT TABLE EXAMPLE

This is an example of a table that you can update to get an overview of how your team performed. The tables show what went well and what didn't go well in the sprint, whether these are general or individual issues. In the lower ones, you'll share the ideas that came up and see who stood out in the group.

(IMAGEM QUADRO RETROSPECTIVA DE SPRINT)

As the aim of the evaluation is to create, evolve and not regress, it is best to fill in this box anonymously so that the comments can be impersonal.
)

Given the importance of this step in the process, here are a few tips and recommendations on how to self-assess your individual performance and that of the team:

ESTABLISH THE PROJECT VISION AT KICK-OFF
(DROPDOWN - GIF CONTRUÇÃO PRÉDIO
If we associate the product being developed with a building under construction, the Kick Off could definitely be related to the foundation that is made, which will represent the strong base that will underpin the other stages that make up the upper stages.
At this stage, the client will present the reasons for their interest in the project, what the general vision of the product is, the needs, desires and the expectations that have been generated).

GIVE OPINIONS AND IDEAS
(DROPDOWN - IMAGEM REUNIÃO DE BRAINSTORMING/IDEIAS
Respectful and constructive opinions and criticism are always welcome. During the group's internal evaluation, it is normal for different opinions and conflicts of ideas to arise regarding some points of the project (not conflicts as in fights and offenses, but as in contradictions and dilemmas). 
These discussions should be seen as positive, as these unequal thoughts will push the team out of its comfort zone, forcing it to look for possible solutions to the dilemma in question. These situations will always result in team growth and a series of possible improvements and new ideas).

ADAPT YOURSELF
(DROPDOWN - IMAGEM CAMALEÃO
Even if this material is your first contact with Scrum, it is assumed that you have already understood how fundamental adaptability will be to the success of your project. One of the greatest advantages of this methodology is the autonomy it gives the team to make changes during the development of the project. 
All of this happens naturally. A new idea arises, new perspectives are accessed as the project progresses, what once made a lot of sense and was considered essential loses its importance and fades into the background, and everything is reformulated and improved).

METODOLOGIA - TEAM
At the start of every project, the team will, based on the client's vision of the product, establish requirements, which refer to the factors that promote a solution or satisfy the client's needs. 

This stage is better known as Kick Off. The composition of these factors will be the final product. The requirements are ordered in a list of priorities called the Backlog, which we will discuss in more detail later.

(CONTEÚDO EXTRA - THE IMPORTANCE OF THE KICK OFF/PREPARING FOR THE START
The Kick Off can be associated with the preparations made by a runner before a race. Analyzing the route to be run and studying the best strategy to adopt are measures that prepare the athlete and increase their chances of achieving good results.

The same goes for the Kick Off. The team will study the objectives to be achieved and draw up strategies so that they can structure a form of development that is organized and aligned with the client's expectations for when the start is given.

(GIF CORREDORES)
)

After establishing the importance of each of these tasks, production begins, giving priority to those that are considered essential, that cannot be missing from the product, and so on.

The requirements are divided into production periods, known as sprints.

The complete project will be made up of a series of Sprints, the amount of which varies according to the complexity of the product.

(IMAGEM - ETAPAS SCRUM)

At the start of each Sprint, the members will get together to align the tasks and strategy that will be adopted. This stage is known as Sprint Planning.

At the end, the aforementioned Sprint Retrospective will be held, which provides an overview of how the team performed and analyzes the pros and cons of the development stage in question.

As for the team members, they will be divided into positions according to their role in the team.

As there is no hierarchical structure in the Scrum team, it is emphasized that these roles refer to the responsibilities that will be assigned to each one.

The positions that every Scrum Team needs to have are: 

Scrum Master 
(ÍCONE - SM)

Product Owner 
(ÍCONE - PO)

Development Team 
(ÍCONE - DEV TEAM). 
 
We'll go into each of these functions in more detail below.

PRODUCT OWNER - PRIORITIZING THE PRODUCT VALUE
The Product Owner, better known as the P.O., is responsible for the product as a whole and must clarify to his team what the client's expectations and general vision are for the project, which must be met during the development period for the product to achieve the final approval criteria.

Their role is that of an interlocutor between the members of their team and the client in question. They will be responsible for capturing the requirements raised by the contractor, taking into account their needs and desires, and forwarding them clearly and concisely to the group.

(CONTEÚDO EXTRA - GOOD COMMUNICATION 
Do you remember that children's game called telephone (also known as "Chinese whispers")? In it, one of the children chooses a sentence that will be passed from one child to the next in whispers until it reaches the last child, who will say what they heard out loud.

(IMAGEM FALANDO NO OUVIDO)

The challenge is to make sure that the sentence reaches the ears of the last child, but a small oversight or misinterpretation can completely change the meaning of the sentence. The same is true for the job of the P.O.

They are responsible for ensuring that there are no misunderstandings when passing on requirements and objectives, so that what was passed on by the client is preserved.
)

Next, the members will jointly carry out a technical analysis of what has been raised and will define the strategy that will be adopted and what measures they will take to carry out what has been requested.

(IMAGEM DE UMA REUNIÃO DE NEGÓCIOS)

It's very important to note that even if the team analyzes each of the particularities of the process together and decides to prioritize certain requirements over others, the client will always have the final say as to what is essential for the project and what is not. It will therefore be up to the P.O. to represent their position within the team environment, as they are responsible for mastering what is of greatest value to the contractor. Therefore, an indispensable characteristic for a good P.O. is to have in-depth knowledge of each facet of the product/service that the team will be dealing with.

Other skills needed to perform this role are good communication and interpersonal skills, and the ability to express ideas and proposed requirements to both the client and the team.

The main tool with which the P.O. will interact throughout the project development period is the Product Backlog.

PRODUCT OWNER - BACKLOG
The Backlog is nothing more than a spreadsheet in which all the project's requirements are listed in descending order of priority (from the most important tasks to the least).

It is essential for the team to have a well-defined Backlog right from the start of the project so that everyone can see not only what is being done at the moment, but also what responsibilities lie ahead.

It should be emphasized that the Backlog spreadsheet is not an internal management tool for the group, but an instrument responsible for guiding both those within production and those outside it, which is the case of the client with whom the team has been cooperating.

It is essential that the client and the team are on the same page with regard to the expectations and execution of the project so that together they can come up with solutions that are effective and exceed expectations.

(DESTAQUE 
Remember that, like all Scrum elements, the Backlog also adapts to changes. One thing is certain: the requirements will change as the Sprints go on!
)

(CONTEÚDO EXTRA - ADAPTING
Think of a long car journey of around 10 hours. Let's say you started your journey at 12 noon and decided to wear lighter clothes because of the heat. However, as time went by, the sun went down and the temperature cooled, so it made more sense for the traveler to wear heavier clothes to keep warm.

The same applies with the course of the project. As the project unfolds, some points that were previously established lose their meaning and changes are needed that make more sense in the situation.
(GIF CARRO NA ESTRADA)
)

(IMAGEM EXEMPLO DA PLANILHA DE BACKLOG)

In addition to the general Product Backlog, another essential worksheet for managing tasks and responsibilities is the Sprint Backlog worksheet. This has the same essence as the general spreadsheet, but with a few more identifications and specifications so that the assigned tasks can be carried out in full.

In this spreadsheet, all the requirements are described using what we call User Stories. These have the function of explaining the requirement in the format of a wish made by someone without technical knowledge, but which sets out the user's expectations in relation to the product they will have in the future.

(CONTEÚDO EXTRA - ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE/ANOTHER'S VIEW
Each person has a unique story. Unique thoughts, unique experiences, unique opinions and unique realities. A successful product will be one that is able to identify these particularities, these different scenarios and bring value to each of them. User Stories are developed to access these various contexts. 
These facilitators are able to make the team look through the lens of the user, find their needs and desires and promote solutions that will bring a better quality of life to the individual and enjoyable experiences.

(IMAGEM LENTES)
)

The standard format for a well-formulated US must contain the following information:

(TABELA - INDIVIDUAL EXPRESSING DESIRE + ACTION/ELEMENT I WISH TO INTERACT WITH + WHY/REASON OF THE FUNCTIONALITY, WHAT IT WILL BRING TO THE EXPERIENCE)
(EXAMPLE: I, AS A STUDENT USER OF THE PLATFORM, WOULD LIKE A PAGE TO CONTACT THE TEACHERS SO THAT I CAN ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CONTENT BEING TAUGHT)

For a task to be able to be added to the Sprint Backlog, it must first pass the Definition of Ready (DoR) sieve, which has the role of qualifying whether a certain task can already be produced or whether there are still any pending issues that make it impossible to carry it out at the moment.

Another item that must be included in the Sprint Backlog is the Task Effort Estimate. 

This field will show how long it will take, from the group's point of view, to carry out a given task, given how difficult it is to accomplish.

Next, the respective requirement from the Product Backlog that defines that US and its acceptance criteria are entered, the latter being one of the main parts of this spreadsheet. It is responsible for indicating what we call the Definition of Done (DoD). Based on these criteria, the group assesses whether the requirement can be classified as completed or not.

SCRUM MASTER - THE METHODOLOGY APPLIED
The Scrum Master is a member of the team who has a good understanding of the Scrum methodology, its practices and fundamental principles.

(IMAGEM - REPRESENTAÇÃO DE ESQUEMA DE PROCESSO)

Its role boils down to monitoring the progress of the project, analyzing the performance of each of the members and concluding whether the development expectations are being met or if any of the parts of the project have any outstanding demands, thus carrying out the principle of INSPECTION.

(CONTEÚDO EXTRA - GOVERNING THE PROGRESS OF THE PROJECT/HOW TO CONDUCT?
One of the greatest examples of exquisite teamwork are orchestras. The combination of different sounds, all synchronized to build a single sound experience, is one of the most beautiful artistic expressions. But managing such an organization so that everyone is in their place is no easy task. Behind every great orchestra there is always a great conductor conducting each part.
(IMAGEM MAESTRO)
In a Scrum team, this is the role of the Scrum Master. He is the one who dictates the progress of the project, setting the pace with which all the individuals will perform their duties. The result: harmony.
)

Another principle that is put into practice through the work of the Scrum Master is TRANSPARENCY.

Some important characteristics for the Scrum Master are organization in the general management of the group's tasks and achievements, good communication skills with the members and a motivating and driving character for the team, being able to identify possible obstacles and hindrances in the process and find methods of minimizing and eliminating them so that there is greater performance from the group.

(IMAGEM - ANALISTA DE RENDIMENTO)

They are the team member designated to make use of strategies and tools capable of integrating the team as a whole, so that all the other members are aware of each other's development and can estimate what stage of the project the group is at and how the distribution of tasks will be established.

In order to ensure that all these issues and principles of the methodology are met, the Master has some tools that will help him check the performance parameters and serve as instruments that make the evolution of the project more tangible to the other members. These tools are the Burndown and the Daily Scrum.

SCRUM MASTER - BURNDOWN AND DAILY SCRUM
The main purpose of the Burndown tool is to manage the internal organization of the team.

Unlike the Backlog, which has the attribute of an external connection with the client, who also interacts and responds to the spreadsheet's requirements, the Burndown is for the exclusive use of the individuals within the group.

Its functionality is similar to that of the Kanban method, where you can visually quantify the gradual development of tasks.

In this way, the team can manage both the tasks that have been delegated from the establishment of the requirements, but also the group's internal development tasks, which the client doesn't need to be aware of, such as research into software technologies and functionalities, study activities, revision tasks and tests.

(IMAGEM - BURNDOWN CHART EXEMPLO)

A special feature of this spreadsheet is its visual property, which gives a more in-depth view of the relationship between project progress and group productivity. Using the Burndown Chart, the team can see whether it is behind, ahead or on schedule in relation to the ideal delivery estimate. 

The Daily Scrum, on the other hand, is a method established by the Scrum Master in which the team holds a daily (or periodic) accountability meeting in which team members update each other on what they are doing and the obstacles they are facing, answering the following questions:

- WHAT WAS DONE THE DAY BEFORE?
- WHAT WILL BE DONE TODAY?
- WHAT ARE THE OBSTACLES?

DEVELOPMENT TEAM - APPLIED TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE
Finally, the last position to be discussed in the Scrum methodology is the Development Team, also known as the Dev Team.

This role includes all the members of the group who participate in the project on the technical development front. These are also popularly referred to as Devs.

(IMAGEM TRABALHO EM EQUIPE)

Their responsibility is to identify, through their specific knowledge, ways of executing the requirements, as well as having a repertoire that adds a lot when it comes to developing functionalities that will improve the user experience.

Some of the important skills for members of the Dev Team are technical knowledge of the technologies, the ability to cooperate, organization with regard to deadlines and transparency regarding the progress of delegated tasks.

CONCLUSÃO
Scrum is this methodology that aims to optimize team production by establishing principles that value:

(IMAGEM EM MOTION DE CICLO)

TRANSPARENCY of the members involved in the project, providing this connection of each front and the progress of their responsibilities.

INSPECTION of each feature through successive applications, error analysis and corrections.

ADAPTABILITY of the project, which undergoes changes in development strategy in order to deliver great value to the client.

In addition, it is very important to understand the responsibilities of each position and their impact so that each of the production sprints meets the expectations for that stage.

So, now that you know each of the fundamental points of the methodology, apply Scrum to your project and achieve greater and more assertive results in an agile and effective way.

Below is some extra content, such as a review of important technical terms, spreadsheet templates and suggestions for tools and systems that will help you in your project.

PUTTING IT INTO PRACTICE
In case you have any doubts about how to apply this methodology, below we have selected some step-by-step methods on how to implement the Scrum Artifacts in your projects.

Self-assessment(
    - Step one: Identifying goals
Identify your goals with the Scrum Master, this could include improving the efficiency of the team, removing obstacles or promoting collaboration between team members.

    - Step two: Evaluate your performance
Evaluate it in relation to the objectives identified earlier, use concrete metrics and data whenever possible, this can include the efficiency of the team, the time spent in meetings and the resolution of impediments.

    - Step three: Identify areas for improvement
After evaluating your performance, identify areas where you can improve. This could include improving communication with the team and removing impediments more effectively, for example. Set specific and measurable improvement goals to improve your performance, such as developing skills, implementing additional agile practices or promoting collaboration between team members, etc.

    - Step four: Action plan and follow-up
Develop an action plan to achieve your goals and monitor your progress by making adjustments to the action plan if necessary.
)

Backlog(
Remember that the backlog is a "living" document and must be updated regularly to ensure that the product's needs are met. Follow these steps:
    - Step one: Identification
Identify the objective of the project before creating the backlog. It is important to understand the objective in order to create a document that meets the needs of the product.

    - Step two: Product requirements
Identify the product requirements, this can include product functionality, user requirements, architecture, remember to prioritize the requirements, based on the value each requirement brings to the product.
(IMAGEM BACKLOG)

    - Step three: Create the user stories
Create the user stories based on the identified and prioritized requirements, which are short, objective descriptions of a product feature that describe what the user wants and why they want it. 
Don't forget to estimate the stories so that the user has an idea of how long it will take to develop each one. Identify the product's requirements, which can include the product's functionality, user requirements, architecture, and don't forget to prioritize the requirements based on the value each requirement brings to the product.
(IMAGEM USER STORIES)
The backlog should contain all the user stories that will be developed during the sprint, so it should be refined regularly to ensure that the stories are up to date and reflect the needs of the product.
)

Daily Scrum(
The daily scrum is a daily meeting to keep the team aligned and engaged, so it is important to ensure that all members are present and that the meeting is held efficiently, to do so, follow this step by step:
    - Step one: Definition
Make an appropriate choice of space and time, this is a quick 15-minute meeting, so it's important to choose a location that allows good communication and a convenient time for everyone.
Identify the objective of the project before creating the backlog, it is important to understand the objective in order to create a document that meets the needs of the product.

    - Step two: Ask the 3 questions
The Scrum Master should start the meeting by explaining the purpose of the daily scrum and reminding everyone on the team of the three questions that must be answered: What has been done since the last meeting? What will be done by the next meeting? Are there any obstacles hindering the progress of the project? The answers to these questions should be short and to the point.
(IMAGEM REUNIÃO)

    - Step three: Problem solving
Stay focused and tackle obstacles. Any issue that is not directly related to the meeting should be discussed after the meeting. And if someone mentions an impediment that is hindering the progress of the project, the Scrum Master should take note and discuss with the team how to solve the problem.
)

Burndown chart(
Below is a video from the TI Carreiras channel where you can learn more about making your own burndown chart.
(VIDEO BURNDOWN)

    - Step one: Defining tasks
Distributing the tasks and the weight of each one before making the chart, assigning the tasks to each person, estimating the effort is what will help to distribute them equally, so that they don't weigh too much for just one person in the group.
An example to help define a weight for a task is <strong>planning poker</strong>, which is a technique based on defining a number sequence
like<strong>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc</strong>, 
and relate it to a time estimate. Below are examples on how to organize both task estimation and planning poker:
(IMAGEM TABELA PLANNING POKER)

    - Step two: Charting
Even though it's optional, the best option for visualizing the team's progress in a timely manner is to draw a physical graph, where you have a timeline that would be ideal for carrying out tasks in a uniform and organized manner and a line showing how the project is progressing in relation to time.
It's important to note that if your project line is above the ideal line, then you're behind on the project, if it's below you're ahead.

    - Step three: Daily update
This theme fits in well with daily scrum, the chart should be updated as tasks are being done, to keep the visualization up to date so that you have an idea of the remaining effort.
Evaluate progress to see if the team is on track to complete all tasks on time.

GLOSSÁRIO

A
Scrum Artifacts
These are all the elements used within the methodology that will help in the execution of the project so that they respect each of the Scrum principles. These include the Backlog, Burndown and Daily Scrums.

Agile Methodologies
Agile methodologies are a set of practices and values that emphasize collaboration, interaction with the client, the delivery of functional software in short cycles and the ability to adapt to changes over time. The best-known agile methodologies include Scrum, Kanban, XP (Extreme Programming), Lean and Crystal.

B
Backlog
This is an important tool for project management, allowing the development team to be clear about the priorities and expectations of the client. During the development process, backlog items are worked on in sprints, which are defined periods of time (usually one to four weeks) in which the team works to deliver the most important features of the backlog.

Burndown
It is a tool used in Scrum to track project progress over time. It shows the amount of work that still needs to be done (y-axis) in relation to the time elapsed (x-axis) during a sprint. The idea is that, over time, the amount of outstanding work will decrease until it reaches zero at the end of the sprint.

D
Daily scrum
This is a daily meeting in Scrum where the development team meets to synchronize and plan the day's work. During the meeting, each member of the team shares what they did the previous day, what they plan to do on the current day and what possible impediments might affect their work.

Definition of Done (DoD)
The Definition of Done is a set of criteria that defines when a task or functionality is considered finished in agile methodologies. It describes the steps that must be completed for the work to be considered finished, including technical, quality and usability requirements. The DoD is usually defined by the development team in conjunction with the Product Owner and is used as a benchmark for assessing the progress of work during a sprint.

Definition of Ready (DoR)
Every project has a progressive nature, meaning that as one task is completed, another will already have the necessary basis and will be ready for execution. This series of prerequisites that make it possible for a task to be carried out corresponds to the Definition of Done, which establishes whether a task can already be produced and thus added to the Sprint Backlog or not.

F
Framework 
A set of tools, guidelines and good practices that help developers build software applications faster, easier and more consistently. It provides a general framework for software development, allowing developers to focus more on solving specific problems than on creating the entire structure from scratch.

K
Kanban
The Kanban method corresponds to an agile methodology that aims to show the progress of development in a visual way by defining tasks in sectors (to do, in progress, completed, etc.). Its signage was commonly associated with the use of colored post-its, but nowadays there is software with the same functionality.

Kick off
In Scrum, this is the initial project meeting in which the team and Product Owner meet to align expectations and define the project's objectives, scope, requirements, deliverables and schedule. It is an opportunity for the team to clarify doubts and better understand the product that will be developed.

M
Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
MVP is a technique used in agile methodologies for developing products and services that focuses on creating a product with the minimum number of features needed to satisfy users' needs. The aim is to quickly launch a product on the market and get feedback from users in order to validate the idea and identify the most important features for future improvements.

S
Software
It is a set of computer programs that control the operation of an electronic device, allowing it to carry out various activities.

Sprint
The sprint in Scrum is a defined period of time (usually one to four weeks) in which the development team works to deliver a defined amount of functionality or product requirements. During the sprint, the team focuses on achieving the objectives defined at the start of the sprint, working on the tasks in the backlog in an iterative and incremental way.

Sprint Planning
In this stage of the methodology, the whole team meets to establish what will be done during the Sprint period. It usually involves dividing up tasks (according to the Backlog), estimating effort, deadlines and other factors.

Sprint Retrospective
The Sprint Retrospective is a meeting held at the end of each sprint in agile methodologies such as Scrum. Its purpose is to evaluate the team's performance during the previous sprint and identify opportunities for improvement for the next sprint. During the retrospective, the team discusses what worked well, what didn't and what can be done differently in the next sprint.

Sprint Review
At this point, everyone who has any involvement with the project (clients, collaborators, marketing, etc.) will be shown each of the elements developed in the Sprint in question, with the aim of validating the product and the process.

U
User Stories
User Stories are a technique used in agile methodologies to define the requirements of a software product. They are written from the user's point of view, describing a specific functionality that the user wants the system to perform. User Stories are usually written in simple language and can be accompanied by acceptance criteria that define what is required for the functionality to be considered complete.

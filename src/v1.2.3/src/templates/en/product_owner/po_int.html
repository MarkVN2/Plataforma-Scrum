      The Product Owner, better known as the P.O., is responsible for the product as a whole and must <strong>clarify to his team what the client's expectations and general vision are for the project</strong>, which must be met during the development period for the product to achieve the final approval criteria.

      Their role is that of <strong>an interlocutor between the members of their team and the client in question.</strong> They will be responsible for capturing the requirements raised by the contractor, taking into account their needs and desires, and forwarding them clearly and concisely to the group.

            Do you remember that children's game called telephone (also known as "Chinese whispers")? In it, one of the children chooses a sentence that will be passed from one child to the next in whispers until it reaches the last child, who will say what they heard out loud.

          <p> The challenge is to make sure that the sentence reaches the ears of the last child, but a small oversight or misinterpretation can completely change the meaning of the sentence. The same is true for the job of the P.O.</p>

            They are responsible for ensuring that there are no misunderstandings when passing on requirements and objectives, so that what was passed on by the client is preserved.</p>

      Next, the members will jointly carry out a technical analysis of what has been raised and will define the strategy that will be adopted and <strong>what measures they will take to carry out what has been requested.</strong>

        It's very important to note that even if the team analyzes each of the particularities of the process together and decides to prioritize certain requirements over others, <strong>the client will always have the final say as to what is essential for the project and what is not</strong>. It will therefore be up to the P.O. to represent their position within the team environment, as they are responsible for <strong>mastering what is of greatest value to the contractor</strong>. Therefore, an indispensable characteristic for a good P.O. is to have
        <strong>in-depth knowledge of each facet of the product/service that the team will be dealing with.</strong>

    <p class="default-para po-int-para">
      Other skills needed to perform this role are<strong> good communication and interpersonal skills, and the ability to express ideas and proposed requirements to both the client and the team.</strong>

    <p class="default-para po-int-para">
      The main tool with which the P.O. will interact throughout the project development period is the
      <strong> Product Backlog.</strong>

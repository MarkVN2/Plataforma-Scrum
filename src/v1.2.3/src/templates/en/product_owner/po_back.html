      The Backlog is nothing more than a spreadsheet in which all the project's requirements are <strong>listed in descending order of priority </strong>(from the most important tasks to the least).
    </p>

    <p class="default-para po-back-para">
      <strong>It is essential for the team to have a well-defined Backlog </strong>right from the start of the project so that everyone can see not only what is being done at the moment, <strong>but also what responsibilities lie ahead.</strong>
    </p>

    <p class="default-para po-back-para">
      It should be emphasized that the <strong>Backlog spreadsheet is not an internal management tool for the group</strong>, but an instrument responsible for <strong>guiding both those within production and those outside it</strong>, which is the case of the client with whom the team has been cooperating.
    </p>

    <p class="default-para po-back-para">
      It is essential that the <strong>client and the team are on the same page with regard to the expectations and execution of the project</strong> so that together they can come up with solutions that are effective and exceed expectations.
    </p>
    
    <!--ConteÃºdo Extra-->
    <p class="default-para po-back-para po-back-para-negr">
      Remember that, like all Scrum elements, the Backlog also adapts to changes. One thing is certain: the requirements will change as the Sprints go on!

            hink of a long car journey of around 10 hours. Let's say you started your journey at 12 noon and decided to wear lighter clothes because of the heat. However, as time went by, the sun went down and the temperature cooled, so it made more sense for the traveler to wear heavier clothes to keep warm. </p>
          <p> The same applies with the course of the project. As the project unfolds, some points that were previously established lose their meaning and changes are needed that make more sense in the situation.</p>

        In addition to the general Product Backlog, another essential worksheet for managing tasks and responsibilities is the  <strong>Sprint Backlog</strong> worksheet. This has the same essence as the general spreadsheet, but with a few more identifications and specifications so that the assigned tasks can be carried out in full.

      <p class="default-para po-back-para">
        In this spreadsheet, all the requirements are described using what we call <a

        title="Glossary: User story">User Stories</a>. These have the function of explaining the requirement in the format of a wish made by someone without technical knowledge, but which <strong>sets out the user's expectations in relation to the product they will have in the future.</strong>

              Each person has a unique story. Unique thoughts, unique experiences, unique opinions and unique realities. A successful product will be one that is able to identify these particularities, these different scenarios and bring value to each of them. User Stories are developed to access these various contexts. 
              These facilitators are able to make the team look through the lens of the user, find their needs and desires and promote solutions that will bring a better quality of life to the individual and enjoyable experiences.

      The essence of Scrum teams is their ability to be <strong>self-managing.</strong> 
    </p>

      This skill allows them to abstract themselves from the situations and scenarios in which they find themselves so that they can  <strong>analyze the process from a critical point of view.</strong>

      This is a fundamental stage of production, because after long hours of development, in which the developers are absorbed in their creativity and ideas, the moments of alignment of vision will be important to <strong>ensure that the project maintains the identity and objectives that have been established.</strong>

At this point, the team will be able to receive external feedback on the development of the work, from which they can direct their future resolutions.

            This is an example of a table that you can update to get an overview of how your team performed. The tables show what went well and what didn't go well in the sprint, whether these are general or individual issues. In the lower ones, you'll share the ideas that came up and see who stood out in the group.

      Given the importance of this step in the process, here are a few tips and recommendations on how to self-assess your individual performance and that of the team:

            If we associate the product being developed with a building under construction, the Kick Off could definitely be related to the foundation that is made, which will represent the strong base that will underpin the other stages that make up the upper stages.
            <br><br>
            At this stage, the client will present the reasons for their interest in the project, what the general vision of the product is, the needs, desires and the expectations that have been generated.

          <p class="default-para met-auto-para">
            Respectful and constructive opinions and criticism are always welcome. During the group's internal evaluation, it is normal for different opinions and conflicts of ideas to arise regarding some points of the project (not conflicts as in fights and offenses, but as in contradictions and dilemmas). 
            <br><br>
            These discussions should be seen as positive, as these unequal thoughts will push the team out of its comfort zone, forcing it to look for possible solutions to the dilemma in question. These situations will always result in team growth and a series of possible improvements and new ideas).

            Even if this material is your first contact with Scrum, it is assumed that you have already understood how fundamental adaptability will be to the success of your project. One of the greatest advantages of this methodology is the autonomy it gives the team to make changes during the development of the project. 
            <br><br>
            All of this happens naturally. A new idea arises, new perspectives are accessed as the project progresses, what once made a lot of sense and was considered essential loses its importance and fades into the background, and everything is reformulated and improved).

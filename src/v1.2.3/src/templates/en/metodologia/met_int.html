        In the past, the main methodology adopted by many institutions became popularly known as <strong>"Assembly line" or "Cascade method".</strong>

    <p class="default-para met-int-para">
      This traditional production system was inherited from the fordist development, during the second industrial revolution, and had as a principle the establishment of <strong>specific and repetitive tasks</strong>, designated to certain individuals <strong>that would little by little be added until they resulted in the expected final product.</strong>

This proceedure kept going for a while, however it was shown to be inefficient and <strong>certain inconstancies that delayed the process were revealed</strong>, mainly during the executions of more complex tasks.

            </p>
  
            <ul>
              <li>Late evaluation (Being late to sinalize flaws in the process)</li>
              <li>Stagnation of the process (leaving part of the work force idle while they await for the moment to carry out their task)</li>
            </ul>
